<p>Was a little nervous to order because company out of USA. <br>
But boy am I glad I did!.The clothing is true to size, fabrics are great and styles up to date and GREAT prices. <br>
Glad I took the chance, now I'm a happy returning customer. Don't get me wrong, we do have stores that caterer to the Fuller FIgure ladies in USA, but after seeing model Tess Munster. <br>
I wanted to know where she got her clothes from. And it was YOURS.</p>
