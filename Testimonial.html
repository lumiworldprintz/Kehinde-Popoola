    A tremendous <strong>THANK YOU</strong> and job <strong>SO VERY WELL DONE</strong> executing our Valentine’s Day year-end celebration yesterday afternoon. <br> 
    You and your staff were highly organized and effectively delivered on a very tight (and shrinking) timeline, all the while maintaining your cool and focus. <br>
    Everything was precisely delivered to plan: the floor plan and flow, linens, flowers, set up and pour of hundreds of champagne glasses, and the multitude of desserts.<br> 
    You and your team executed beyond my expectations.  I look forward to working with you and your team again in the future.</p>
